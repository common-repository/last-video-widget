A widget that displays the last post af a category and resize its video. Viper's Video Quicktags plugin needed.

== Description ==

This plugin allows to place a widget on your sidebar, that will fetch the last post of the category you specify, and display it inside the widget. In addition, if that post contains a youtube video tag inserted by the Viper's Video Quicktags plugin, that video will be resized to the specified size, so you can fit it nicely in your sidebar width.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the wordpress plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. A new "Twitter List Widget" will be available.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will that post be displayed twice? Once in the blog loop and once on the sidebar? =

Yes... There are other plugins around for doing more complex things than this one, and with a bit of coding it is also possible to prevent your blog from displaying posts from a certain category.
